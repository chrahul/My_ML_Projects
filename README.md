Here I'm going to build end-to-end machine learning model. Also, at the end  I'm going to deploy over Azure apps so that we can access it like a Web App.


**About the Dataset:**

Bengaluru is best place for foodies. Restaurants from all over the world can be found here in Bengaluru. From United States to Japan, Russia to Antarctica, you get all type of cuisines here. Delivery, Dine-out, Pubs, Bars, Drinks,Buffet, Desserts you name it and Bengaluru has it.

Currently which stands at approximately 12,000 restaurants. With such an high number of restaurants. This industry hasn't been saturated yet. And new restaurants are opening every day. 

The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurant at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant, Bengaluru being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world.



# Work Flow



## Part -1 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis

- Use graphical techniques to gain an understanding of the data and the interactions between variables.
- Look at what can be learned from the data.
- Statistical properties like distribution of data, correlation.
- Discover outliers



**Techniques**:

- Boxplot – can show the maximum, minimum, median, and other characterizing measures at the same time.

- Histogram – In a histogram a variable is cut into discrete categories and the number of occurrences in each category are summed up and shown in the graph.

- Pareto diagram – is a combination of the values and a cumulative distribution.

- Tabulation

- Clustering and other modeling techniques can also be a part of exploratory analysis.
